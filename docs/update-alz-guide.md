# Update Azure Landing Zones Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides best practices and considerations for updating Azure Landing Zones (ALZ). It is essential to ensure that updates are performed systematically to maintain the integrity and performance of your Azure environment.

## Best Practices
1. **Backup Existing Configurations**: Before making any updates, ensure that you have backups of your existing configurations and deployments. This will allow you to restore previous states if necessary.

2. **Review Change Logs**: Always review the change logs of the modules and templates you plan to update. Understanding what has changed will help you anticipate any impacts on your current setup.

3. **Test in a Non-Production Environment**: Before applying updates to production, test the changes in a staging or development environment. This helps identify potential issues without affecting live services.

4. **Use Version Control**: Maintain your Bicep files and configurations in a version control system. This allows you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with team members effectively.

5. **Document Changes**: Keep detailed documentation of any changes made during the update process. This includes modifications to parameters, modules, and any custom logic implemented.

## Update Process
1. **Identify Components to Update**: Determine which Bicep modules or configurations need to be updated based on your review of the change logs and your current environment.

2. **Modify Bicep Files**: Make the necessary changes to your Bicep files. Ensure that you follow best practices for coding and structure.

3. **Validate Parameters**: Use the `validate-params.ps1` script to ensure that all parameters meet the required specifications before deployment.

4. **Deploy Updates**: Use the `deploy-alz.yml` workflow to deploy your updates. Monitor the deployment process for any errors or warnings.

5. **Post-Deployment Validation**: After deployment, validate that all resources are functioning as expected. Check logs and metrics to ensure that the updates have not introduced any issues.

## Considerations
- **Downtime**: Be aware of potential downtime during updates, especially for critical resources. Plan updates during maintenance windows if necessary.
- **Dependencies**: Consider the dependencies between resources. Updating one module may affect others, so ensure that all related components are updated accordingly.
- **Compliance and Security**: Ensure that updates comply with organizational policies and security standards. Review any new policies introduced in the updates.

## Conclusion
Updating Azure Landing Zones is a critical process that requires careful planning and execution. By following the best practices and processes outlined in this guide, you can ensure a smooth and successful update experience.

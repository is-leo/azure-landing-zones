# Architecture of Azure Landing Zones

## Overview

The Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) provide a set of guidelines and best practices for deploying and managing Azure resources in a structured and efficient manner. This document outlines the architecture of the Azure Landing Zones, detailing the key components and their interactions.

## Key Components

1. **Bicep Modules**
   - The ALZ utilizes Bicep as the infrastructure as code (IaC) language to define and deploy Azure resources. The main Bicep template orchestrates the deployment of various modules, including custom modules for monitoring and policy enforcement.

2. **Resource Groups**
   - Resources are organized into resource groups based on their lifecycle and management requirements. This structure allows for better resource management and cost tracking.

3. **Networking**
   - A well-defined networking architecture is crucial for secure and efficient communication between resources. The ALZ includes guidelines for setting up virtual networks, subnets, and network security groups.

4. **Identity and Access Management**
   - The ALZ emphasizes the importance of identity and access management. Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to ensure that users have the appropriate permissions to manage resources.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Monitoring and logging are integral to maintaining the health and performance of Azure resources. The ALZ includes custom modules for setting up monitoring solutions and logging mechanisms.

6. **Policy Enforcement**
   - Azure policies are used to enforce compliance and governance across the Azure environment. The ALZ provides custom modules for defining and applying management and billing policies.

## Interactions

- The main Bicep template serves as the entry point for deployments, calling various modules based on the defined architecture.
- Custom modules for monitoring and policies are invoked as needed, allowing for a modular and reusable approach to resource management.
- Resource groups are created and managed according to the guidelines, ensuring that resources are logically grouped and easily manageable.

## Conclusion

The architecture of Azure Landing Zones is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and efficient framework for deploying and managing Azure resources. By following the outlined components and interactions, organizations can achieve a well-structured Azure environment that meets their operational and governance needs.
